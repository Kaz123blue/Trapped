              You suddenly wake up locked inside an old house with no recollection of how you got there. It seems that you must explore and solve puzzles to find a way out.
              <br>
              Throughout the game you will have to figure out why and how you got there, while making vital decisions that will decide your fate and possibly enable your escape of the abandoned house.
